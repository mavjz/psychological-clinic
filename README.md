## Technologies I used

For this project I use React library with **NextJS** and **TS** frameworks. For styling I depends on **SASS** language. 
Also it was my first time using **REST API** what was quite a challenge early on. In same time in make myself 
learning asynchronous functions which turns out to be nessesery to work with fetching data.
